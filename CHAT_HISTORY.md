Chat Session Log â€” DesignSystemMonoRepo

Summary of work completed in this session:

- Scaffolded pnpm monorepo and created `packages/design-system`.
- Storybook added and pinned to `8.6.14` with Vite builder and pnpm-specific resolve workarounds.
- Stitches setup:
	- `src/utils/stitches.ts` created/updated to export `styled`, `css`, `globalCss`, `getCssText`, `createTheme`, `darkTheme`, and `setTheme()`.
	- Theme tokens added: `colors` (including `textOnPrimary`, `surface`, `muted`, `border`), `fonts` (Pretendard first), `radii`.
- Button component:
	- `src/components/atoms/Button/Button.tsx` implemented using Stitches tokens and `variants` (size, tone).
	- `src/components/atoms/Button/Button.types.ts` created with `ButtonSize`, `ButtonTone`, and `ButtonProps`.
	- Stories updated to use new component API.
- Storybook UX:
	- `.storybook/preview.ts` updated to include `globalTypes` for theme and a decorator that applies `setTheme()`.
	- Floating theme toggle overlay added to the canvas so theme can be toggled even if Storybook toolbar isn't visible.
	- `.storybook/preview-head.html` added to load Pretendard from CDN for consistent typography.

What I pushed to `origin/main`:

- All the files listed above were committed with message: "chore: apply stitches themes, Button types, Storybook preview toggle, add Pretendard and chat history"

Exact next steps you can run at home:

1) Start Storybook (from repo root or package):

```powershell
cd C:\Users\SAMDORY\Desktop\Project\DesignSystemRepo\packages\design-system
pnpm run storybook
```

2) Typecheck the package:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\SAMDORY\Desktop\Project\DesignSystemRepo\packages\design-system
pnpm run typecheck
```

3) Run unit tests (if you add any):

```powershell
pnpm run test
```

4) To update storybook font or theme values, edit:

- `packages/design-system/.storybook/preview-head.html` (font CDN)
- `packages/design-system/src/utils/stitches.ts` (tokens and theme colors)
- `packages/design-system/.storybook/preview.ts` (toggle behavior)

Notes & Privacy:

- This file contains a concise summary and actionable steps to continue development. It does not include the raw chat transcript by default.
- If you want the full conversation transcript (raw messages), say so and I will add it to the repo. Be aware that including full chat logs in git will make them public in the repo history.
- If you'd prefer no chat content in the repo, I can remove `CHAT_HISTORY.md` and rewrite the commit to remove it from history (requires force-push and repository history rewrite).

If you want me to also push the full raw chat transcript, or remove this file from the repo history, confirm which action to take and I'll perform it.
